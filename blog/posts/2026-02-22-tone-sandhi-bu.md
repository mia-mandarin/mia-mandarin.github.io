When learning Chinese, "不" (bù) is one of the most essential negation words you'll encounter. But many learners notice something puzzling—sometimes it sounds like "bù" (fourth tone), and sometimes it changes to "bú" (second tone). What's going on?

## The Basic Pronunciation of "不"

First, let's establish the fundamental rule: "不" is **originally a fourth tone word (bù)**. In most cases, it maintains this fourth tone.

Mandarin Chinese has four basic tones:
- **First tone (ā)**: high flat tone
- **Second tone (á)**: rising tone
- **Third tone (ǎ)**: falling-rising tone
- **Fourth tone (à)**: falling tone

## The Tone Sandhi Rules

When "不" combines with other syllables, there's an important tone change rule to remember:

### Rule 1: Keep the Fourth Tone

When "不" is followed by syllables in the **first, second, or third tone**, it keeps its original fourth tone:

**+ First tone:**
- 不听 (bù tīng) - not listening
- 不通 (bù tōng) - not through/connected
- 不知 (bù zhī) - not know

**+ Second tone:**
- 不来 (bù lái) - not coming
- 不行 (bù xíng) - not okay
- 不忙 (bù máng) - not busy

**+ Third tone:**
- 不好 (bù hǎo) - not good
- 不错 (bù cuò) - not bad
- 不想 (bù xiǎng) - not want

### Rule 2: Change to Second Tone

When "不" is followed by a **fourth tone syllable**, it changes to **second tone (bú)**:

**+ Fourth tone:**
- 不去 (bú qù) - not going
- 不是 (bú shì) - is not
- 不要 (bú yào) - do not want
- 不对 (bú duì) - not correct
- 不见 (bú jiàn) - not see

## Why Does This Change Happen?

This tone sandhi rule exists to make pronunciation smoother and more natural. Chinese speech emphasizes "flow" and rhythm. When two fourth tones appear together (like bù qù), it can sound choppy and difficult to articulate. Changing to the second tone (bú qù) creates a rising-then-falling pattern that flows better.

Think of it this way: Chinese speakers naturally avoid "bumping" sounds together. The tone change creates a smoother transition.

## Practical Dialogue Example

Let's practice with a short conversation:

**Scene: A friend invites you out**

> Friend: 我们周末要去爬山，你去吗？
> (Wǒmen zhōumò yào qù páshān, nǐ qù ma?)
> *We're going hiking this weekend, are you going?*
>
> You: 我不去，天气不好。
> (Wǒ **bú qù**, tiānqì **bù hǎo**.)
> *I'm not going, the weather is not good.*
>
> Friend: 那我们去喝茶？
> (Nà wǒmen qù hēchá?)
> *Then shall we go for tea?*
>
> You: 茶馆太远，我不想去。
> (Cháguǎn tài yuǎn, wǒ **bù xiǎng** qù.)
> *The teahouse is too far, I don't want to go.*

Pay attention to:
- "不去" (bú qù) - "不" changes to second tone because "去" is fourth tone
- "不好" (bù hǎo) - "不" keeps fourth tone because "好" is third tone
- "不想" (bù xiǎng) - "不" keeps fourth tone because "想" is third tone

## Common Mistakes

Many learners make these errors:

❌ **Wrong:** 不去 (bù qù) - keeping fourth tone everywhere
✅ **Correct:** 不去 (bú qù) - changing to second tone

❌ **Wrong:** 不要 (bù yào)
✅ **Correct:** 不要 (bú yào)

❌ **Wrong:** 不是 (bù shì)
✅ **Correct:** 不是 (bú shì)

## Memory Trick

Here's a simple mnemonic to help you remember:

> **"不 meets four, becomes two"**
> (When "不" meets a fourth tone, it becomes second tone)

Or in Chinese:
> **"不遇四，变二声"**

## Practice Tips

1. **Listen carefully**: Pay attention to how native speakers pronounce "不" in different contexts
2. **Practice with tone pairs**: Drill common combinations like bù hǎo, bú qù, bù xíng
3. **Record yourself**: Compare your pronunciation with standard audio
4. **Use it in conversation**: The more you use it, the more natural it becomes

## Quick Reference Chart

| Following Tone | "不" Pronunciation | Example | Pinyin |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|--------|
| 1st tone | bù (4th tone) | 不听 | bù tīng |
| 2nd tone | bù (4th tone) | 不来 | bù lái |
| 3rd tone | bù (4th tone) | 不好 | bù hǎo |
| 4th tone | bú (2nd tone) | 不去 | bú qù |

## Extended Learning

Besides "不", Chinese has other tone sandhi rules worth exploring:
- The tone changes of "一" (yī - one)
- Third tone sandhi (when two third tones appear together)

We'll cover these in future articles!

## Summary

The tone sandhi rule for "不" is straightforward:
- Before 1st, 2nd, or 3rd tone → Keep fourth tone (bù)
- Before 4th tone → Change to second tone (bú)

Master this rule, and your Chinese pronunciation will sound much more natural and native-like!
